Uno card game made in javascript using socket.io, express, and ejs. The players start with 7 random cards and their goal is to get rid of them all. Would use socket.io game rooms to put people into different games. Have different game room codes to join peoples games, and have it so the person who started the room can start the game when everyone is ready. Io listeners to detect whenever someone tries playing a card and will check is the game started, what game room it is, what player, what card, do they actually have that card in their hand. If all is good then add the card to the discard pile and remove it from the players hand. Play the cards effects(if any) and advance the turn. Once a player reaches one card they must press the uno button before playing the card or they will gain +2 cards if someone catches them. Once someone gets rid of all their cards display who won and ask players if they would wanna play again. After the game works and is made implement digipogs (a type of fake currency made) to have players pay in the lobby before they get to play.
